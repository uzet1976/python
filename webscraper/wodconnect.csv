Workout,The Kaiada ,"Day 1Warm up:- Full body static stretching- Dynamic stretching- 50 USMC crutches - 8 Pull ups- 15 minute run at 30-40% effortWorkout:-  3 Mile Tempo Run   - Mile 1  50% effort   - Mile 2 60-70% effort   - Mile 3 80% effort     - Last 100 yards should be ran at 90% effortCool Down:- Quarter mile walk- Cold showerWhy the name?Legend has it that when a child was born in Sparta a physician would conduct a thorough inspection of the newborn.  Obsessed with creating the perfect soldiers, children who were deemed unfit for Spartan society due to deformity were carried into the mountains and thrown into a pit known as the ""Kaiada.""Today you begin your journey.  The tempo run allows one to remain oblivious to time, yet completely focused on one's effort.  Instead of time dictating your workout, you are in control.  This control is displayed as you gradually increase effort you devote to this workout.  Starting off at half speed and gradually increasing in effort will teach you the discipline of being able to control your pace and push yourself the extra mile.  Running is as much a mental challenge as it is physical. So reflect on your run today.  Are you demonstrating self control; or starting off to fast?  Are you truly unable to increase your effort; or do you simply not feel like it?  If your mind wills it and you can honestly say that you did the workout to the best of your ability, you have survived the Kaiada.   ",https://www.wodconnect.com/workout_lists/the-agoge
Workout,The Pankatias ,"Day 2Warm up- 100 jumps using jump rope- Full Body Stretching- 50 USMC crutches- 10 pull upsWork out - Shadow Boxing (3 minutes)  - 1 minute walking rest- Heavy Bag Striking (5 minutes)  - 1 minute  walking rest- 30-30-30 heavy-bag drill (3X)  - 30 seconds of moderate striking  - 30 seconds of speed striking with high knees  - 30 seconds of heavy striking     -1 minute walking rest-Heavy Bag Striking (5 minutes)Cool down-100 jumps-10 minute jogAlthough Ancient Greek athleticism became a phenomena that allowed young men to become career athletes, the reason for such an emphasis on athleticism was to train soldiers for war.  One of the more brutal games that were played was known as ""Pankration.""  The object of the game was to beat your opponent as close to death as possible.  Biting and eye gouging were prohibited, and killing your opponent would merit an automatic forfeit.  This program will not train you to become a professional Pankatias, but it does recognize the importance of cross-training.  Even ancient runners would spar and employ training methods used by Pankatiasts.  By training on a heavybag you will be able to complete a respectable core, endurance, and cardio workout without the strain and impact associated with running.  Plus its fun!  Remember that this workout is meant to be used as a recovery workout.  Every punch and kick you generate should stem from your core!  Feel free to do an additional ab workout before the cool down as well. ",https://www.wodconnect.com/workout_lists/the-agoge
Workout,The Taygetos,"Day 3Warm up:- Full body static stretching- Dynamic stretching- 15 minute run at 30-40% effortWork Out:- (6) Hill repeats @ Kohala Retreat CenterCool down:- 5 minute walk- cold showerWhy the name?- The Taygetos is the highest mountain range in Greece, and is said to have been the final destination of Greek criminals, traitors, and captives.  Though being sent to the hill country was a major punishment, you have chosen to take on the hill as an opportunity for greatness.  Strength is integral to become a skilled runner, and obtaining it entails that you will feel a burn.  Remember to focus on your form and kill the hill! ",https://www.wodconnect.com/workout_lists/the-agoge
Workout,Rest Day,"Day 4Warm up:- Full Body Stretching- 10 minute jogWork out: -30 minute run at %40-50-70 USMC crunches- 14 pull upsCool Down:Light stretching Why the name?Well. . .you don't have to know Greek to understand the reasoning behind this name.  After a long day doing hill repeats, your legs are going to feel punished, so reward them by taking a nice and easy jog.  You will also notice that the amount of pull ups and crunches has increased since you're not working your legs hard.  Maybe you're wondering why they're called USMC crunches too.  Well, the reason why is because you are training to pass the physical fitness test of America's Spartans.In order to score a perfect PFT score, a Marine must not only be able to run 3 miles in 18 minutes (your goal).  They must be able to do 100 modified crunches and 20 pull ups in under 2 minutes per exercise.  By completing all of these exercises in the given amount of time, a perfect score of 300 points will be awarded to the Marine.Rest up and remember that the crunches and pull ups aren't all that bad once you've finished them. ",https://www.wodconnect.com/workout_lists/the-agoge
Workout,Marathon,"Day 5Warm up:-10 minute jog -Full Body Stretching-Dynamic StretchingWork out:-5 mile run at 60-70% effortCool Down:- 5 minute walk- Cold ShowerWhy the name?The legend of the Marathon run dates back to the year 490 B.C. when a military messenger by the name of Pheidippides ran from a battlefield at the site of the town of Marathon, Greece, to Athens.  When he arrived, Pheidippides was said to have proclaimed ""Niki!"" (""victory"") before collapsing to his death.And here you are!  You are about to complete your first week of training.  Once you finish today's workout, the weekend is yours!  Endurance is the third component of a skilled runner.  So as you push through these 5 miles, remember the proclamation of Pheidippides; ""Niki!""   ",https://www.wodconnect.com/workout_lists/the-agoge

For example, in round one, after completing the 14 kettlebell swings, complete 38 push-ups. The following round start again at the 400m run, complete 20 wall balls, 14 kettlebell swings, and 38 air squats. Continue in this way for all 5 rounds. This hero workout is dedicated to Patrolman Christopher Mark Goodell of Waldwick, NJ, who died on July 17, 2014 in a collision between a truck and his stationary unmarked police car.A New Jersey native, and a lifelong resident of Waldwick, Chris graduated from Waldwick High School in 2000 and attended one semester at William Paterson University. In response to the September 11 attacks, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Chris served his country proudly for the next five years as a C-130 navigator, participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom. During his service, he achieved the rank of Sergeant and continued in the Marine Corps reserves for three additional years. Chris then went on to serve the residents of his hometown of Waldwick as a Police Officer for the next six years. Chris truly loved his job and served the community with dedication and devotion. Chris was engaged to be married to Jillian Voss and they were planning a 2016 wedding.This workout was created by CrossFit Waldwick @crossfitwaldwick (Waldwick, NJ) as a fundraiser for the Christopher Goodell Scholarship Fund. From the gym: ""Waldwick is your typical small town with a very tight knit community. We have a few police offers in our gym who worked with Chris and many members are close with his family.'The 20 and 14 repetitions are for the year Chris passed away. His badge number was 38, hence the 38 reps per movement. The 5 rounds and 5 different movements at the end of each round represent the 5 years he served as an officer. Chris specifically loved running and bodyweight movements.",https://www.wodconnect.com/workout_lists/hero-wod-s-by-tomi-k

He was one of four men from his company who entered Tower Two to search for survivors, 10 minutes before the tower collapsed.""Chris was young, but he had the makings of a great firefighter,"" Capt.
